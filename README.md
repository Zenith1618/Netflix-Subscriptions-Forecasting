Forecasting the number of subscriptions Netflix will achieve in a given time period is a crucial practice that empowers the company to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and strategically plan content releases. This project demonstrates the application of the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast Netflix's quarterly subscription growth. The forecasts generated by this model can assist Netflix in understanding their potential subscriber base and shaping their business strategy accordingly.

## Overview

Netflix is a leading player in the highly competitive streaming industry. Accurate subscriber growth forecasts are essential for making informed business decisions. This project leverages time series analysis techniques to predict Netflix's quarterly subscription growth.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook, `Netflix Forecast.ipynb`, which is divided into several sections:

1. **Importing Libraries:** In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and time series modeling.

2. **Importing Dataset:** The dataset, `Netflix-Subscriptions.csv`, is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The data includes columns for the time period and the number of subscribers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations, including quarterly and yearly growth rates, help in understanding the subscription trends.

4. **Using ARIMA for Forecasting:** The ARIMA model is employed to forecast Netflix's quarterly subscription growth. The order of differencing (p, d, q) is determined based on the AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) plots. The model is trained on historical data, and predictions for the next five quarters are made.

5. **Visualizing Predictions:** The original subscription data and ARIMA predictions are visualized to illustrate the forecasted growth.

## Usage

You can follow these steps to use the ARIMA model for Netflix subscription forecasting:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly statsmodels
   ```

3. Place your subscription data in a CSV file with columns named "Time Period" and "Subscribers."

4. Update the `data` variable in the notebook to read your dataset:

   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('Your-Netflix-Subscriptions-File.csv')
   ```

5. Run the notebook to generate forecasts and visualize the results.

## Results

The ARIMA model predicts Netflix's quarterly subscription growth, providing valuable insights for strategic planning and decision-making.

## Conclusion

Time series forecasting, as demonstrated in this project, allows Netflix to estimate future subscription growth accurately. This information aids in operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy, contributing to Netflix's continued success in the competitive streaming industry.

By leveraging this forecasting technique, Netflix can stay ahead of the curve, ensuring they meet subscriber demands and achieve their growth targets.
